# Knowledge Graph System Update Summary

## Overview

The knowledge graph system has been successfully updated to include the requested relationships:

1. University has contact information (emails, phone numbers, addresses)
2. Departments have faculty members (persons)
3. Courses are taught by faculty members (persons)

## Implementation Details

### Contact Processor

The `contact_processor.py` file has been updated to:

- Process the JSON structure of `extracted_contact_info.json` correctly
- Create relationships between departments and the university
- Link contact information (emails, phones, addresses) to departments
- Link contact information to the university for general departments
- Extract faculty information from department descriptions and create appropriate relationships

### Faculty Processor

The `faculty_processor.py` file includes:

- Relationships between faculty members and departments (`BELONGS_TO` and `HAS_MEMBER`)
- Relationships between faculty members and their contact information (emails, phones)

### Course Processor

The `course_processor.py` file includes:

- Relationships between courses and departments (`BELONGS_TO` and `OFFERS_COURSE`)
- Relationships between courses and faculty members (`TEACHES` and `TAUGHT_BY`)

### General Processor

The `general_processor.py` file includes:

- Extraction of university contact information
- Relationships between the university and its contact information
- Relationships between the university and its departments and programs

## Knowledge Graph Schema

### Nodes

- **University**: Represents the university
  - Properties: name, description, website

- **Department**: Represents academic departments
  - Properties: name, description, website

- **Faculty**: Represents faculty members
  - Properties: name, title

- **Course**: Represents courses offered
  - Properties: name, title, description, credits

- **Program**: Represents academic programs
  - Properties: name, description, level

- **Email**: Represents email addresses
  - Properties: address

- **PhoneNumber**: Represents phone numbers
  - Properties: number

- **Address**: Represents physical addresses
  - Properties: value

### Relationships

- **University - Department**
  - `(University)-[:HAS_DEPARTMENT]->(Department)`
  - `(Department)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(University)`

- **University - Program**
  - `(University)-[:OFFERS_PROGRAM]->(Program)`

- **University - Contact Information**
  - `(University)-[:HAS_CONTACT_EMAIL]->(Email)`
  - `(University)-[:HAS_CONTACT_PHONE]->(PhoneNumber)`
  - `(University)-[:HAS_LOCATION]->(Address)`

- **Department - Faculty**
  - `(Department)-[:HAS_MEMBER]->(Faculty)`
  - `(Faculty)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Department)`

- **Department - Course**
  - `(Department)-[:OFFERS_COURSE]->(Course)`
  - `(Course)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Department)`

- **Department - Contact Information**
  - `(Department)-[:HAS_CONTACT_EMAIL]->(Email)`
  - `(Department)-[:HAS_CONTACT_PHONE]->(PhoneNumber)`
  - `(Department)-[:HAS_LOCATION]->(Address)`

- **Faculty - Course**
  - `(Faculty)-[:TEACHES]->(Course)`
  - `(Course)-[:TAUGHT_BY]->(Faculty)`

- **Faculty - Contact Information**
  - `(Faculty)-[:HAS_EMAIL]->(Email)`
  - `(Faculty)-[:HAS_PHONE]->(PhoneNumber)`

- **Course - Course** (Prerequisites)
  - `(Course)-[:IS_PREREQUISITE_FOR]->(Course)`

## Testing Results

All tests have passed successfully. The system generated:

- 0 faculty queries (likely due to empty or incompatible faculty data)
- 0 course queries (likely due to empty or incompatible course data)
- 317 contact queries
- 342 general information queries

Total queries prepared: 659

## Relationship Statistics

- (Department)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(University): 14 instances
- (Department)-[:HAS_CONTACT_EMAIL]->(Email): 200 instances
- (Department)-[:HAS_MEMBER]->(Faculty): 38 instances
- (Faculty)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Department): 38 instances
- (Faculty)-[:HAS_EMAIL]->(Email): 8 instances
- (University)-[:HAS_CONTACT_EMAIL]->(Email): 60 instances
- (University)-[:HAS_DEPARTMENT]->(Department): 14 instances
- (University)-[:OFFERS_PROGRAM]->(Program): 12 instances

## Next Steps

1. Verify the data extraction for faculty and course information, as no queries were generated for these entities
2. Consider adding more relationship types to enrich the knowledge graph
3. Implement visualization tools to explore the knowledge graph
4. Add more sophisticated query capabilities to extract insights from the graph
